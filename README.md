# Mods of Mistria Installer

This is the in-progress installer for Fields of Mistria mods. At the moment it's pre-alpha without releases. It's written
in C# for the purpose of integrating into the [Undertale Mod Tool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool)
when importing sprites. As a result, it's also licenced under the GPL-3.0 copyleft licence.
